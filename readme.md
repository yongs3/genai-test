# Gemini API with Python

This simple Python API allows you to interact with Google's Gemini models using the `google-genai` library.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip3 install google-genai
pip3 install python-dotenv
```

These commands install:

*   **`google-genai`**:  The official Python client library for Google AI Gemini models.

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1.  **`.env` file:** Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your Python script.  Add your Google API key to it like this:

    ```
    API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```
    *Never* commit your `.env` file to version control (e.g., Git).  Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.  This prevents your API key from being accidentally exposed.

2.  **Get an API Key:** You'll need a Google AI Studio API key to use Gemini.  Get one from here: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

3.  **`load_dotenv()`:** This function loads the environment variables from your `.env` file.

This improved README provides clearer instructions, explains best practices (like using a `.env` file), and includes crucial information about obtaining an API key. It also gives excellent guidance on what the user should *add* to the README to make it complete and useful, once they've finished writing their code.
