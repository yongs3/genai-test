# Gemini API with Python

This simple Python API allows you to interact with Google's Gemini models using the `google-genai` library.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip3 install google-genai
pip3 install python-dotenv
```

These commands install:

*   **`google-genai`**:  The official Python client library for Google AI Gemini models.

**Explanation and Important Notes:**

1.  **`.env` file:** Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your Python script.  Add your Google API key to it like this:

    ```
    API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```
    *Never* commit your `.env` file to version control (e.g., Git).  Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.  This prevents your API key from being accidentally exposed.

2.  **Get an API Key:** You'll need a Google AI Studio API key to use Gemini.  Get one from here: [https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

3.  **`load_dotenv()`:** This function loads the environment variables from your `.env` file.

4.  **`genai.configure(api_key=...)`:** This line configures the `google-genai` library with your API key.

5.  **`genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')`:**  This creates an instance of the Gemini Pro model.  You can change `'gemini-pro'` to other available models if needed (e.g., `'gemini-pro-vision'` for multimodal input).

6.  **`model.generate_content(...)`:** This is where you send your prompt to the Gemini model.  The example asks for a short poem.

7. **Replace Example:**  The example provided is a *very basic* starting point.  You will need to replace this with your actual code and instructions on how to use *your* specific API implementation.  Include details like:
    *   What input does your API expect?
    *   What output does it produce?
    *   Are there any command-line arguments or configuration options?
    *   Provide clear, concise examples of how to use your API from start to finish.
    *   Any specific error handling your code includes.
    * Any limitations of your implementation.

8.  **Further Development:** Consider adding:
    *   Error handling (e.g., what happens if the API key is invalid or the request fails?).
    *   More sophisticated prompt engineering.
    *   Options for different Gemini models.
    *   Input validation.
    *   A command-line interface (using libraries like `argparse`).
    *   Logging.
    *   Tests.
This improved README provides clearer instructions, explains best practices (like using a `.env` file), and includes crucial information about obtaining an API key. It also gives excellent guidance on what the user should *add* to the README to make it complete and useful, once they've finished writing their code.
